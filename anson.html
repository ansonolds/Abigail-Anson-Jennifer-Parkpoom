        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Anson's Fool-Proof Pancakes</h1>
        <p>Pancakes are a special dish that seem to show up right when you need them. Whether your kids are waking up after a sleepover, or you find yourself groggily stumbling into the kitchen to find that the only food left in your cupboard is a box of pancake mix from 2006, pancakes are a safe and surefire method of feeding the masses with little to no effort. That being said, if you don't have a box of pancake mix lying around, trying to make pancakes from scratch can be an intimidating process for the beginner. In this recipe you will find an easy recipe to remember; one that can be modified to meet dietary requirements or tastes depending on the situation.

        <h2>Here's what you need:</h2>
        <p>These ingredients are staples you should stock your pantry with. Some need to be refridgerated, but most of them can stay on your shelves for a long time without worrying about expiration dates.</p>
        <h3>Basic Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Flour</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>1 cup Milk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp canola Oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Butter or Margarine for spreading</li>
            <li>Pancake or Maple Syrup for drizzling</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="flavortext">Substitutions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For a simple gluten free swap, substitute 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill or King Arthur 1 to 1 gluten free flour for the wheat flour.</li>
            <li>For non-dairy eaters substitute 1 cup of Almond, coconut, oat, cashew, or any non-dairy alternative for the 1 cup of milk. Try to use a milk that is similar in consistency, as thicker liquids will make the pancakes thicker (which you might want).</li>
            <li>Milk that has gone bad recently can be used instead of fresh milk. The taste is not effected.</li>
            <li>Buttermilk can also be used for a simple buttermilk pancake.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="flavortext">Modifications:</h3>
        <p>For a fancier pancake, try some of these suggestions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tsp of either lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to the batter for a slightly fluffier pancake.</li>
            <li>Add in some fruit or nuts after you've poured your batter onto the pan. Try banana and walnut; blueberry; chocolate chip; or cooked bacon.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Instructions-->
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat your pan on med-low heat. Be sure to use a pan big enough to cook either one large pancake or two to three small pancakes. I prefer to use a 12-inch cast iron frying pan because it has steady and even heat over the entire cooking surface. The only issue with a thicker pan is that it takes longer to get to working heat. Give it plenty of time to heat up before you even mix your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Begin by separating your ingredients (except for butter and syrup) into two bowls. One large, and one medium. Place all wet ingredients in one bowl, and all dry ingredients into the other.</li>
            <li>Hover your hand over the pan to get a sense of the heat. (Don't touch the pan with your hand). If you feel the heat is distributed over the whole surface of the pan, pour a quarter sized drop of oil onto the cooking surface. If the oil starts to ripple and runs quickly, you know the pan is hot. If the oil starts to smoke, it's too hot. Distribute oil around the pan with a spatula, or by tilting the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is hot enough, mix your wet and dry ingredients into the large bowl. Use a whisk to break up clumps of solids. Only mix ingredients until just mixed. Don't worry about getting all of the clumps, <b>don't overmix.</b></li>        
            <li>Scoop 1/2 to 1 cup of the batter onto the hot pan depending on the size of the pancake you want. I prefer 6-8 inch pancakes, while some prefer 3-4 inch "silver dollar" pancakes.</li>
            <li>At this point, if you would like to add fruit, nuts, chocolate chips, or any other ingredients to your pancakes, now is the time to do so. Drop them onto the uncooked side of the pancake.</li>
            <li>Once you start to see bubbles forming and popping on the uncooked side of the pancake it's time to flip. Use a spatula that takes up as much of the area of the pancake as possible, as a small spatula will split a large pancake in half.</li>
            <li>The target color should be a deep golden brown. This can take some practice to get the right balance between a golden exterior and a cooked interior. When in doubt always err the side of using a low temperature, and be patient. <b>Do not pat the pancake with the spatula while it is cooking. It will make the pancake dense and rubbery.</b></li>
            <li>Once the pancakes are cooked through, plate them, spread with Butter or Margarine, and drizzle syrup on top. If you're using refridgerated pancake or maple syrup, try putting the syrup in a microwave safe container, and microwaving for 15-30 seconds. This will help to keep your pancakes from getting cooled by the cold syrup.</li>
            <li><span class="flavortext">Enjoy!</span></li>
